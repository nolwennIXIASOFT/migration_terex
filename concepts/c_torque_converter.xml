        <p>The torque converter consists of three elements - pump, turbine, and stator. The pump is
            the input element and is driven directly by the engine. The turbine is the output
            element and is hydraulically driven by the pump. The stator is the reaction (torque
            multiplying) element. </p>
        <p>When the pump turns faster than the turbine, the torque converter is multiplying torque.
            When the turbine approaches the speed of the pump the stator starts to rotate with the
            pump and turbine. When this occurs, torque multiplication stops and the torque converter
            functions as a fluid coupling. </p>
