    <p>The torque converter consists of three elements -
    pump, turbine, and stator. The pump is the input
    element and is driven directly by the engine. The
    turbine is the output element and is hydraulically
    driven by the pump. The stator is the reaction (torque
    multiplying) element.</p>
    <p>A series of planetary gears and shafts provide the
    gear ratios and directions of travel for the vehicle.
    Power flow through the planetaries is controlled by
    multiple clutch packs. The clutches are applied and
    released hydraulically in response to electrical signals
    from the ECU.</p>
