<conbody><p>The transmission oil and filters should be changed at the intervals specified, or sooner,
			depending on operating conditions. Also, the oil must be changed whenever there are
			traces of dirt or evidence of high temperature indicated by discoloration or strong
			odour. The screen and magnet assembly in the sump should be removed and cleaned with
			mineral spirits at each oil change. Metal particles in the oil (except for the minute
			particles normally trapped in the oil filters) indicate damage has occurred in the
			transmission. </p>
<p>When these particles are found in the filters, the cause must be established and rectified
			immediately to prevent damage to the transmission. At each oil change, examine the used
			oil for evidence of dirt or water. A normal amount of condensation will emulsify in the
			oil during operation of the transmission. However, if there is evidence of water or
			engine coolant in the oil, the cause must be established and rectified immediately to
			prevent damage to the transmission..</p></conbody>
