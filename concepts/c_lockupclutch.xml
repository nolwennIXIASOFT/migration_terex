<p>The lockup clutch is located inside the torque
converter and consists of three elements - piston,
clutch plate, and backplate. The piston and backplate
are driven by the engine and the clutch plate, located
between the piston and backplate, is splined to the
converter turbine.
</p>
<p>The lockup clutch is hydraulically engaged and
released in response to electrical signals from the
ECU. It engages when the vehicle reaches a
predetermined speed. Engagement of the lockup
clutch provides a direct drive from the engine to the
transmission gearing. This eliminates converter
slippage to provide maximum fuel economy. The
lockup clutch releases at lower speeds (and
momentarily during shifts). When the lockup clutch is
released, drive from the engine is transmitted
hydraulically through the converter to the transmission
gearing. The lockup clutch also releases when the
ECU detects certain undesirable conditions.</p>
