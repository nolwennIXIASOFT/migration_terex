<p>Check the transmission oil level and add oil if low, every 10 hours/daily. Use only oil of the
            type specified by your dealer. Because the transmission oil cools, lubricates and
            transmits hydraulic power it is important that the proper oil level be maintained at all
            times. </p>
        <p>If the oil level is too low, the converter and clutches will not receive an adequate
            supply of oil. </p>
        <p>If the oil level is too high, the oil will aerate and the transmission will overheat. </p>
        <p>It is absolutely necessary that the oil put into the transmission be clean. Oil must be
            handled in clean containers to prevent foreign material from entering the system.</p>
