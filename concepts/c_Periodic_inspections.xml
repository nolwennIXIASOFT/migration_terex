<p>For easier inspection, the transmission should be kept
clean. Make periodic checks for loose bolts and
leaking oil lines. Check the condition of electrical
harnesses and connections regularly.</p>
<p>The transmission breather should be checked
regularly and as frequently as necessary, depending
on the operating conditions of the vehicle. A badly
corroded or plugged breather restricts proper
breathing and causes a buildup of condensation and
subsequent oil deterioration.</p>
