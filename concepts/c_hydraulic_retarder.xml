		<p>A vaned rotor and two vaned stators are the basic components of the retarder. Application of
			the retarder control valve fills the cavity around the rotor with oil when the vehicle
			must be slowed on steep downgrades. When the cavity is emptied, the rotor is free of
			drag. </p>
		<p>Maximum retarder effect occurs in the lowest gear
		range with foot off of the accelerator pedal. Long continuous 
		use of the retarder will raise transmission
		oil temperature. Short periods of full release, to interrupt
		continuous application, will help prevent overheating.</p>
		<p>During normal operation the dash mounted
		transmission oil temperature gauge should read in the 
		green zone. However, during transmission retarder
		operation oil temperature can enter the yellow
		'Retarder On' zone but should not enter the red zone.</p>
